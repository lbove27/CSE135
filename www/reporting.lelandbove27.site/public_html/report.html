        <h2>Which browsers are experiencing errors? How often and what kind?</h2>

        <section id="errors">
            <div>
                <p>Total Errors: </p>
                <p id="total-errors"></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Errors Today:</p>
                <p id="errors-today"></p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <p>
            The total errors show how many errors there have been in the past,
            and errors today shows if there still need to be improvement in the amount of errors experienced by users.
        </p>
        <section id="charts">

        <p>The data shows that there are the most errors occurring in Chrome, 
            but Chrome also has the largest number of users. On the other hand, 
            Safari has no errors, but almost no users. It also shows that nobody is 
            using any other browsers. Lastly, we can see that the errors occurring most
            often are http errors, meaning there could be a problem with bots looking
            for pages that don't exist or a broken link that needs to be fixed.
